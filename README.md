# Debt Recovery Analysis Project

## Project Overview

In the financial sector, the process of recovering debt after it has been declared "uncollectable" involves strategic decision-making. Banks employ different recovery strategies based on their expectations of the recoverable amount from delinquent customers. This project delves into a scenario where a bank assigns customers to various recovery strategies, aiming to optimize the incremental amount collected while considering the additional costs associated with higher recovery strategies.

The non-random assignment of customers to recovery strategies creates a unique challenge, necessitating a thorough examination of whether the benefits in incremental collection surpass the added costs. This situation is akin to threshold assignments seen in diverse fields such as medicine, education, finance, and the public sector.

## Project Tasks

1. **Regression Discontinuity: Banking Recovery**
   - Utilize the regression discontinuity method to analyze the effectiveness of recovery strategies in the banking sector.

2. **Graphical Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Employ graphical representations to explore the key features and patterns within the dataset.

3. **Statistical Test: Age vs. Expected Recovery Amount**
   - Conduct a statistical test to evaluate the relationship between age and the expected recovery amount.

4. **Statistical Test: Sex vs. Expected Recovery Amount**
   - Perform a statistical test to assess the impact of gender on the expected recovery amount.

5. **Exploratory Graphical Analysis: Recovery Amount**
   - Explore the distribution and trends related to the recovery amount through graphical analysis.

6. **Statistical Analysis: Recovery Amount**
   - Perform statistical analysis to gain insights into the recovery amount, uncovering patterns and correlations.

7. **Regression Modeling: No Threshold**
   - Develop a regression model without considering a threshold to understand the baseline relationship.

8. **Regression Modeling: Adding True Threshold**
   - Enhance the regression model by incorporating the true threshold, accounting for nuanced relationships.

9. **Regression Modeling: Adjusting the Window**
   - Fine-tune the regression model by adjusting the window, refining the analysis for more accurate results.

Embark on this journey of data-driven decision-making in the financial landscape, unraveling the complexities of debt recovery strategies and their impact on the bottom line.
